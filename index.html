<<h1>Amit Srivastava</h1>


<h4>About Me</h4>
<h3>Immediate past</h3>
I was a graduate student with the Computer Science dept. at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA.
I took courses aimed at systems and networks. I also pursued Master's Thesis that focused on Google's not so 
new network/application protocol -- QUIC aka Quick UDP Internet Connections.

<h3>Long time ago</h3>
Before have had the good fortune to work at several big and small companies and I leanrt a lot at each place 
and made a lot of friends. I have lived in New Delhi, Bhopal, Chennai and Worcester. Now I live in Boston (Somerville). 
I like computer networks and find the re-newed interest in network protocols to rescue over internet from giant 
corporation, operating systems and governments very interesting, and possibly my calling. I have dabbled with 
SDNs but I plan to write my own network protocol (in Python).
